## About Ni

I am a Ph.D candidate advised by Prof. Wyatt E. Tenhaeff at the University of Rochester majoring in Chemical Engineering with a concentration in optical thin films and vacuum deposition systems. 

I received my M.S. degree from Columbia University in the City of New York in 2018, and received my B.S. degree from Beijing University of Chemical Engineering in 2016. 

I paln to gratuate in early spring 2023 and currently I am looking for full-time research/engineer internship. Feel free to contact me for any intern opportunities, Thank you!
