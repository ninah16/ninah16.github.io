## Research Experiences
`Mar. 2021 - Present`
### Project: Ultra-high refractive index thin film by vapor deposition for optoelectronics	             
* Designed, prototyped, and assembled a customized initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) reactor.
* Developed a fabrication method for preparing high refractive index polymer via iCVD for applications including microlens for complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, antireflective (AR) coatings, and Encapsulants for LEDs, etc.

`Jan. 2020 - Present`
### Project: Flexible antireflective coating by vapor deposition for deformable lenses                              
* Prepared AR coating by using iCVD and physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques respectively and compared their optical performance, mechanical durability, and thermal stability on flexible substrates.
* Conducted failure analysis of organic/inorganic AR coating on flexible substrate under repeated biaxial strain.
* Developed the processing - structure - property relationship of iCVD fabricated polymeric films by Ellipsometry, White Light Interferometry, SEM, and XPS. 

## Programming Projects
`Oct. 2020 - Present`
### Project: Development and maintenance of a reactor control software                                              
* Developed a PLC software for controlling a chemical reactor by using LabVIEW, interfaced the platform desktop with the instruments involved in this reactor system.
* Reverse-engineered the reactor's previous control software, troubleshot process components interfering with process control and data collection.
* Streamlined program design to optimize experiment efficiency and simplified maintenance process.

`Sept. 2018 - Jan. 2019`
### Project: Temperature distribution simulation of Andorian tomb 				         
* Familiarized theory of heat transfers in certain media in a spherical coordinate system.
* Developed a partial differential equation (PDE) model by using Python to describe the heat transfer in a hemispherical shell.
* Solved the boundary conditions of the problem by matching terms, simulated the temperature distribution of the inner wall of the Andorian tomb.
